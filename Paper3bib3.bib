	abstract = {Kenya’s invasion of southern Somalia, which began in October 2011, has turned into an occupation of attrition – while “blowback” from the invasion has consolidated in a series of deadly Al-Shabaab attacks within Kenya. This article reviews the background to the invasion, Operation Linda Nchi, and the prosecution of the war by Kenya’s Defence Forces up to the capture of the city of Kismayo and the contest to control its lucrative port. The second section discusses Al-Shabaab’s response, showing how the movement has reinvented itself to take the struggle into Kenya. We conclude that while the military defeat of Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia seems inevitable, such a victory may become irrelevant to Kenya’s ability to make a political settlement with its Somali and wider Muslim communities at home.},

	abstract = {Networked, transnational forms of violence pose a significant threat to peace and security in a number of sub-Saharan African countries. In recent years, Kenya has witnessed an expanding number of attacks involving Al-Shabaab – the Somali-based militant organisation. Kenya’s state responses to these attacks derive from a social construction of Somalis as a threatening presence, justifying a raft of hard security measures. However, this targeting has been counter-productive by driving a deeper wedge between Somalis, other Muslims and the state, and levels of Al-Shabaab violence have remained high. Seen from the social and political margins that Kenya’s Somali and Muslim populations occupy, recent violence continues a long-standing dynamic of insecurity in which the state itself is a central actor. Internal stress relating to state-led planning of social order built on unequal citizenships and the use of violence, enmesh with the external threat of Al-Shabaab, producing the conditions for insurgency and violence to spread. Reducing violence and building peace require greater understanding of how violence and security are seen and experienced at the margins.},

In contrast to the common perception—as depicted through government responses—radicalization and recruitment extends well beyond Somali and Kenyan–Somali nationals. Instead of exclusively focusing on external or environmental factors, the study on which this article is based analyzed the personal background of those being radicalized. This article will focus on the role the family and peers play in the political socialization process while analyzing factors influencing radicalization, most notably religious identity, economic, political, and educational background of al-Shabaab members. Based on interviews with al-Shabaab and family members the last part of the article evaluates when, why, and how respondents joined al-Shabaab. Through answering these key questions the Kenyan government and other agencies assisting in preventing radicalization can develop more effective counterradicalization and counterterrorism strategies based on empirical evidence.},

The capture of Kismayu by KDF has weakened the nerve of Al-Shabaab but has not eliminated the imminent danger of a substantive terror attack. Since the incursion by KDF, Kenya has succumbed to a sequence of grenade and Improvised Explosive Devices attacks, roadside bombs, landmines and raids by fighters, using small arms and light weapons and Rocket Propelled Grenades against Kenyans, mostly in North Eastern, Coastal and Nairobi counties, marking the resurgence of terrorism in the country. The authors have argue that, Kenya is more vulnerable to Al-Shabaab terrorists attack than before the KDF incursion, by citing the frequencies of reprisal attacks from October 2011 to January 2013. Hence, their troops should be withdrawn and deployed within their boundary.},

The study is informed by insights from 30 in-depth qualitative interviews carried out between 2016 and 2019 in Mombasa with religious leaders, academic experts, community members and various government agencies. Purposive and convenience sampling techniques were used to collect qualitative data, which were analysed thematically. Secondary data was collected from books, academic journals, newspapers and grey literature.

However, Kenyan counter-terrorism measures have been criticised for overstepping legal boundaries, often degenerating into practices of indiscriminate repression against suspect communities. Adopting a social movement theory approach, this article investigates whether, and above all how, such practices may have detrimental effects, increasing radicalisation. The article shows that, by exacerbating frictions and widening socio-political divisions in the country, indiscriminate repression has increased a motivation to mobilise into terrorism among targeted groups while, at the same time, shaping conducive conditions enabling them to do so through emerging connections with Al-Shabaab. Such findings have substantial implications, highlighting the need for more targeted strategies tackling terrorism without setting in motion dynamics of violent interaction further undermining national security.},

	abstract = {Scholars have identified a range of terrorist strategies that militant groups employ to influence intended audiences, but there is scant empirical valida­ tion. Following Kenya’s invasion of Somalia in late 2011, Al-Shabaab executed retaliatory terrorist attacks in Kenya with the strategic aim to compel the withdrawal of Kenyan troops from Somalia. Drawing on unique in-depth inter­ views with Al-Shabaab defectors and civilian witnesses to counterterrorism measures in Kenya, this article investigates the strategic motives underlying AlShabaab’s transnational terrorist operations and assesses the effect these have had on the intended audiences. The empirical findings reveal that the attrition strategy has underpinned Al-Shabaab’s major terrorist attacks (large-scale events) whilst their minor terrorist attacks (small-scale events) have been motivated by the provocation strategy, aimed at eliciting a repressive state overreaction against Kenya’s Somali and Muslim minorities. Whilst the major terrorist attacks succeeded in fomenting the Kenyan public’s anti-war views, this did not result in troop withdrawal; the minor terrorist attacks, however, engendered harsh state repression and draconian measures against Kenya’s Somali and Muslim minorities, ultimately exacerbating existing grievances and channelling fresh recruits to Al-Shabaab. This article contributes to the growing literature on terrorist strategies, offering nuanced empirical insights to under­ standing the strategic motives underpinning transnational terrorist campaigns. The article demonstrates that transnational terrorism campaigns are rooted in the strategic need to influence different audiences abroad. Depending on militant groups’ short- and long-term objectives, the type of attack indicates the type of terrorist strategy they will employ.},

This article argues that this variation is determined by the incentives political entrepreneurs have to enter a war. The higher the demand for political change and the lower the costs of fighting, the more incentives entrepreneurs have to form their own group. Analyzing UCDP data for all civil wars between 1946 and 2015 I find that the two measures of demand – the number of identifiable ethnic or religious groups in a country and the size of the disgruntled population – have the most consistent effects, but that key measures of costs such as the size of the government military also matter. A detailed analysis of the Ethiopian case further reveals the influence of external intervention on the formation of rebel groups. These results suggest that rebel groups emerge in civil wars in rational, predictable ways related to the ease by which rebel elites can mobilize separate groups for fighting.},

Integrating research on civil war and terrorism, we distinguish between direct and remote violence. Quantitative analyses show that the involvement of jihadist groups in this conflict had a strong impact on the level and intensity of violence of all warring parties. Qualitative analysis of data collected during field research done in Mali between 2016 and 2017 complements the quantitative work. It enlightens that relational dynamics strongly influence the decision to resort to violence within non-state armed groups, including jihadist ones, while local contexts often explain temporal and geographic variations in violence.},

	abstract = {Abstract : In January 2013, France launched military operations in northern Mali. Backed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2085 (December 2012) that authorized the deployment of an African-led International Support Mission in Mali, Operation SERVAL sought to wrest control of northern Mali from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and affiliated groups. The reestablishment of security in the country s north was a necessary prerequisite for addressing other factors in Mali s complex crisis, namely the coup that overthrew the civilian government and the long-running Tuareg nationalist movement. Dr. Dona J. Stewart's monograph explores the underlying root causes of the complex crisis in Mali that created a safe haven for militants and criminals in the country's remote and impoverished northern region. A series of Tuareg rebellions, the latest fueled by the so-called Arab spring and the end of Muammar Gaddafi's regime, combined with increasing AQIM activity, severely strained the central government's ability to maintain security. AQIM quickly capitalized on the security vacuum created by the March 2012 military coup. Today, a significant level of physical security has been reestablished in the north and a new president has been elected; but Mali must overcome significant challenges in order to achieve long-term stability. Dr. Stewart argues that long-term stability in Mali must address the economic and political disparities that undermine effective national integration.},

The Malian state had lost touch with the people, and its military was divided. Many Malians welcomed the military intervention, but a long-term solution must be found to build durable peace.

	abstract = {Scholars have advanced the idea of environmental scarcity to explain the Tuaregs' rebellions in West Africa. However, most governments in the Sahel tend to view the Tuaregs' rebellions as acts of terrorism so they can benefit from US assistance against its global war on terror. Using two case studies, Mali and Niger, this paper contends that the Tuaregs' rebellions are the result of not only grievances from political exclusion and the neglect of the Sahelian governments to develop the Tuaregs' zones, but also the result of fixed colonial borders that have negatively affected Tuaregs' cultural values and livelihood. The Malian and Nigérien governments should find means to resolve these rebellions quickly because Islamic and terrorist groups are taking an active interest in the Sahel, providing social services to a large destitute population that these governments have neglected.

	abstract = {The decentralisation programme in Mali received a boost when municipal elections were finally held in 1998–99. This programme, initiated in 1992, is notable for its scope and the degree of autonomy extended to rural and urban communes. Given Mali's history of failed attempts at decentralisation, the current administration's commitment to the programme suggests that political motives are driving the reform. The decentralisation effort began as an attempt to placate separatist Tuareg groups in the north of Mali, and was subsequently extended to include the rest of the country. I argue that the extent of the programme, as well as the relative zeal with which it has been carried out, are products of a political strategy of cooptation on the part of President Alpha Oumar Konaré. This political analysis of decentralisation serves as a supplement to policy analyses of decentralisation in general.},

The authors systematically apply the Collier-Hoeffler model to 15 countries in 6 different regions of the world, using a comparative case study methodology to revise and expand upon economic models of civil war. The book concludes that the "greed" versus "grievance" debate should be abandoned for a more complex model that considers greed and grievance as inextricably fused motives for civil war.},

In the case of Mali, these issues were all brought together in the same place and brutally erupted at the same time during the course of the year 2012, provoking disintegration and the subsequent French military intervention. Today, the secessionists have been defeated, the terrorists have been pushed back, the soldiers have returned to their barracks and democratic and free elections have taken place. However, there remains a lot to be accomplished. But, Mali undoubtedly has the capacity and the strong will to move forward towards peace, security, the rule of law, and good governance.},

	abstract = {Negotiated civil war terminations differ from their interstate war counterparts in that one side must disarm and cease to exist as a fighting entity. While termination through military victory provides a relatively more enduring peace, many civil wars end with peace agreements signed after negotiations. However, research has shown that the implementation of civil war peace agreements is difficult and prone to collapse. Often these failures are followed by recurrence of the conflict. In some cases, the agreements break down before key provisions are implemented. This article adds to this topic by focusing on the role of state capacity in peace agreement success. We argue that peace agreements and state capacity are necessary but not sufficient conditions for sustainable peace. The article employs a case study approach to explore the importance of state capacity in implementing civil war peace agreements. The role of third-party interventions is also considered. The cases (United Kingdom–Northern Ireland, Indonesia–Aceh, Burundi, Mali, and Somalia) include 14 peace agreements that vary by war type (secessionist or control over government), type of agreement (comprehensive or partial), levels of state capacity (high or low), and peace success (success, partial or failure), and each experienced third-party involvement in the peace process.},

Although each of these rebellions was ended by a cease-fire, the Malian government never succeeded in instituting longer term peace agreements. The 2012 Tuareg rebellion has presented even more significant security threats. The environment in northern Mali now is marked by multiple armed groups, with multiple competing agendas. This complex situation, with Tuareg rebels, Islamists with varying goals, and local militias, with a pattern of varying levels of cooperation and conflict, will at best be very difficult to resolve in the long term. Combined with an almost complete security vacuum in northern Mali on the part of the government, this situation could be intractable even with external intervention. At the same time, the focus on counterterrorism in northern Mali may not be conducive to a long-term resolution of what in reality is a much more complicated security environment.},

	abstract = {Why are some peace processes accompanied by bloody political violence while others are not? Recent scholarship suggests that when factions fear that they will not benefit or will be excluded from a negotiated settlement these groups may protect their interests by sabotaging the peace process through violent tactics. We compare three peace processes in Africa – the negotiations to end armed struggles in Mali, the Western Sahara and Sudan – to investigate why spoilers arise in some contexts and not others. We argue that peace process exclusivity, that is negotiations between only some of the potential parties to a conflict, is more likely to breed violence than inclusive peace negotiations where all relevant groups have a seat at the bargaining table. A key to our argument is that the number and form of combatant groups is endogenous to peace process negotiations; as a result, exclusivity encompasses not just leaving out warring parties but also the exclusion of groups that might object to the terms of the peace should they be left out of the bargaining process. This is particularly important since many peace agreements include provisions regarding the distribution of government services, jobs, and representation that may indirectly impact the availability of those goods for other stakeholders, particularly non-combatant parties. While inclusive agreements may be harder to reach, our findings suggest that international organisations that participate in peace negotiations need to carefully consider the real-world trade-off between the ability to reach an agreement and the sustainability of that agreement over time.},

	abstract = {This article analyses the precarious alliances concluded between insurgent groups in the context of the conflict in Northern Mali that began in 2012. Building on the literature on civil wars and social movements, it develops a mechanism-based approach that intends to shed light on the processes of alliance formation and disintegration that are taking place at the meso- and micro-levels of analysis. It shows that the solidity and durability of alliances in a civil war context strongly depend on the interplay of three intra-organizational and inter-organizational mechanisms (brokerage, competition and shifting alliance), which contribute to the shaping of complex local power games. While ideological compatibility facilitates alignment and organizational collaboration, alliances are first and foremost cemented or fissured through the changing short- and mid-term personal interests of a variety of actors, who try to adapt to a volatile context.},

Unfortunately, the spread of civil war and state collapse to the Middle East and North Africa region in the last fifteen years has posed one set of problems that the current policy repertoire cannot address well–for several reasons, conflicts in this region are resistant to “treatment” by international peacekeeping operations–and has highlighted a second, deeper problem whose effects are gradually worsening and for which there does not appear to be any good solution within the constraints of the present UN system. That is, for many civil war–torn or “postconflict” countries, third parties do not know how to help locals build a self-governing, self-financing state within UN-recognized borders or, in some cases, any borders.},

While both COIN approaches ultimately produced similar peace settlements, the article argues that the Malian strategy of reconciliation combined with the selective use of force was far more effective than the Nigerien iron fist approach at limiting the size and scope of the insurgency and producing a more sustainable peace. It concludes by looking at the role of external actors, particularly the United States, and how the failure to internationalize the conflict was actually more beneficial to the local COIN effort, as well as to the longer strategic interests of the United States in the region.},

	abstract = {According to the influential `environmental security' literature, supply-induced scarcity in the form of environmental degradation is a key driver of civil violence around the world. African drylands, especially the Sahel region, are allegedly among the areas most seriously affected by this development. Views of desertification and severe environmental degradation in the Sahel are held by environmental security scholars, despite the comprehensive literature questioning such ideas that has been published since the late 1980s. Instead of being steadily transformed towards more desert-like conditions through increasing population pressure, Sahelian environments are dominated by climatic fluctuations. This article first reviews the literature criticizing the idea of `desertification' as it is applied on African drylands. Then, the article critically discusses the use of the Tuareg rebellion in northern Mali as an example of a supply-induced scarcity related conflict. The case study shows that the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s played a role in the rebellion, but the rebellion was not driven by supply-induced scarcity. Instead, the droughts led to the migration of young men to Algeria and Libya, where they were exposed to revolutionary discourses. There was already a strong feeling among nomads and Tuareg in Mali of being marginalized by state policies of modernization and sedentarization. Embezzlement of drought relief funds by government officials in Bamako added further to the anger felt by the young men who took up arms against the Malian state. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s was probably not a necessary condition for the rebellion to take place. Detailed case studies of armed conflicts, engaging with environmental research, may be necessary to further deepen our understanding of links, or lack of such links, between violence and environmental stress.},

This study explores the variation in the provision of stability by regional powers via a mixed-methods approach. By contrasting the intensity of regional crises with issue salience at the UN General Assembly, we select crises that drew varying attention from regional powers, despite similar severity. Focusing on Brazil and South Africa as potential regional stabilizers, we compare responses to regional crises that displayed high (Haiti and Somalia) and low (Colombia and Congo-Brazzaville) salience. We find that domestic support, concerns with status and potential competition with other stabilizers tend to play a large part in calibrating regional power responses.},

	abstract = {Conflict Dynamics presents case studies of six nation-states: Sierra Leone, the Republic of Congo, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Peru. In the book, Alethia H. Cook and Marie Olson Lounsbery examine the evolving nature of violence in intrastate conflicts, as well as the governments and groups involved, by focusing on the context of the relationships involved, the capacities of the conflict's participants, and the actors' goals. The authors first present a theoretical framework through which the changeable mix of relative group capacities and the resulting tactical decisions can be examined systematically and as conflicts evolve over time. They then apply that framework to the six case studies to show its usefulness in better understand-ing conflicts individually and in comparison.While previous research on civil wars has tended to focus on causes and outcomes, Conflict Dynamics takes a more comprehensive approach to understanding conflict behavior. The shifting nature of relative group capacity (measured in many different ways), coupled with dynamic group goals, determines the tactical decisions of civil war actors and the paths a rebellion will take. The case studies illustrate the relevance of third parties to this process and how their interventions can influence tactics.The progression of violence in conflicts is inextricably linked to the decisions made in their midst. These influence future iterations of the conflictual relationship. Complex groups on both sides both drive and are driven by the decisions made. Understanding conflicts requires that these reciprocal impacts be considered. The comparative frame-work demonstrated in this book allows one to flesh out this complexity.},

	abstract = {In 1991 in the Republic of Congo, a sovereign national conference in Brazzaville inaugurated a peaceful transition from socialist one-party government to multi-party democracy. The pluralization of public voices in the newly liberalized country - in religious movements, political parties and independent presses - expressed new conditions of understanding about the nation and its affairs. At the same time, local networks and categories of perception inflected geopolitical pressures from foreign powers into quasi-ethnic divisions in competition for power through government representation. Subsequent conflict over contested elections sparked devastating civil war in 1997 and resulted in the return to power of the former socialist leadership. Given the uncertainties - indeed, the crises of institutions and of knowledge - during these times, how did Congolese diagnose the troubles through which the country passed? This article examines how national and socialist ideals and practices were evoked and reinterpreted to this end in public discourse through idioms of family, affliction, spiritual power and the living body. These modes of speech and action give evidence of longer-term continuities in the region's political imaginations, as these incorporated changes brought by ongoing involvement in larger modern worlds. /// En 1991, dans la République du Congo, une conférence nationale souveraine inaugurait à parti unique vers une démocratie pluripartite. La pluralisation de las parole publique dans le nouveau pays libéralisé, au sein des mouvements religieux, des partis politiques et de la presse indépendante, a exprimé de nouvelles conditions d'interprétation de la nation et de ses affairs. Dans le même temps, des réseaux locaux et catégories de perception ont altéré les pressions géopolitiques des puissances étrangères en divisions quasi-ethniques en concurrence pour le pouvoir à travers la représentation du gouvernment. Le conflit surgi au lendemain des élections contestées a déclenché la terrible guerre civile de 1997 et débouché sur le retour au pouvoir des anciens dirigeants socialistes.

The official body count reached 15 000. These clashes, an extension of the 1993-1995 conflict between the government's militia and those of another branch of the opposition, resulted from the legitimacy crisis set off when the agreement between ex-President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his successor, Pascal Lissouba, was broken. They fit into the structural opposition between the north and south, itself ensuing from the conflict that founded the state in 1959. These clashes represent a new episode in the fight inside the Historical Left to obtain exclusive control over both the state and the wealth produced by the country's major resource, oil.},

	abstract = {South Sudan obtained independence in July 2011 as a kleptocracy – a militarized, corrupt neo-patrimonial system of governance. By the time of independence, the South Sudanese “political marketplace” was so expensive that the country’s comparatively copious revenue was consumed by the militarypolitical patronage system, with almost nothing left for public services, development or institution building. The efforts of national technocrats and foreign donors produced bubbles of institutional integrity but the system as a whole was entirely resistant to reform. The January 2012 shutdown of oil production bankrupted the system. Even an experienced and talented political business manager would have struggled, and President Salva Kiir did not display the required skills. No sooner had shots been ﬁred than the compact holding the SPLA together fell apart and civil war ensued. Drawing upon long-term observation of elite politics in South Sudan, this article explains both the roots of kleptocratic government and its dire consequences.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the social and political implications of wartime and post-war resource capture in South Sudan. It argues that predation by armed groups during the second civil war (1983–2005) initiated a process of dominant class formation, and demonstrates how, through various strategies of resource capture and kinship networks, commanders from the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) and other factions formed a new aristocracy – a “dominant class” that thinks of itself as “the best”. Drawing on Marcel Mauss’s analysis of ‘gifts’, it describes how commanders, through gifts of bridewealth and wives to their subordinates, formed a lower stratum of followers that strengthened their position. After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the military elite in power has maintained this lower stratum through the deployment of nepotistic and clientelist networks. The article discusses three modes through which the elite has sought to distinguish itself, showing how the elite has used the lower stratum to demonstrate its prestige and inﬂuence in the post-war period, and how the elite’s ostentation and widespread corruption have triggered popular resentment in which old ethnic enmities sometimes resurface.},

Yet, systematic research of the linkages between communal violence and civil war is sparse. This contribution connects communal violence research to the stabilization and peacekeeping debate. To further a more systematic analysis of communal conﬂicts, I distinguish various types and their linkages to civil war and peacebuilding. In South Sudan, large-scale communal conﬂicts—communal wars—precede the country’s civil war and are likely to succeed it. Their protracted and fundamentally political nature means that they cannot be addressed as ‘local conﬂicts’ in isolation from national politics and state institutions. I argue that military force may temporarily stabilize a conﬂict zone but the horizontal linkages between urban and rural communal conﬂicts and their vertical linkages to national political processes require concerted efforts on the national and the sub-state level to avoid renewed conﬂict cycles and contribute to lasting stability.},

The article surveys the first year of this war. It outlines the course of military engagements, the consequences of the war for the people of South Sudan and the ways in which a peaceful settlement has been sought. During 2014 external initiatives and threats of sanctions were employed to prod the warring parties into a productive process, but with only limited success because each side entrenched itself while waiting for the other to collapse. Developments in January 2015 indicate that the time might be ripe for a negotiated settlement: the parties have reached military stalemate and negotiations have sketched the contours of a settlement. What remains is the haggling over the finer points of a political compromise. However, mediators and the parties must pick up the pace because yet another year of war will possibly result in the disintegration of South Sudan as a polity.},

	abstract = {South Sudan is a prime example of how governance arrangements can either achieve and maintain peace, or become the trigger for civil war. South Sudan's experience shows that the appropriateness of constitutional provisions to a local context remains key, and that the time-tested elements of good governance still matter: devolution and separation of powers, appropriate government and electoral systems, and strong institutions. In nations as ethnically diverse as South Sudan, decentralization is necessary for effective public participation, and it also contributes to bringing government closer to the people and empowering local governments to be more responsive to their constituencies' needs. Ineffectual decentralization, on the other hand, leads to marginalization of some groups, and causes allegiances to form along ethnic rather than national lines. Should fighting break out in such a context, the conflict frequently takes on an ethnic nature, as it has in South Sudan. While failures in decentralization and other governance arrangements may have provoked civil war in South Sudan, addressing such weaknesses through constitutional amendments and capacity building, for example, may put the country back on track towards achieving and maintaining peace and stability. Other key reforms would include economic diversification, improved natural resource management, and tighter budgetary control. Despite the significant challenges ahead, there is hope yet for the world's youngest nation.},

The IGAD mediation was characterised by inconsistencies, contradictions, sudden changes and retractions. This lack of steadfastness gave contradictory signals to the warring parties, which at last made them loose trust in the regional organisation. Both parties accused IGAD of siding with the other. The underpinning factor of the inconsistencies in the IGAD mediation is the diverging national interests of member states. IGAD failed to put at the centre of its peace mediation the plight of the people of South Sudan. The central argument the paper tries to advance is that national self-interest of the mediators caused the collapse of the mediation. The trust of the warring parties on the mediators is a necessary condition for a successful mediation.},

Subsequently, in 2011, however, the country was partitioned and the conflicts in Sudan and South Sudan have continued unabated. Interrogating the treaty texts and employing a case study approach and analysis of the economic and power dynamics within the region, this paper addresses the reason behind the failure of the comprehensive peace agreement and subsequent agreements intended to bring peace after partition. It becomes evident that the same dynamics that fed the partition of the country have helped bring conflict within its two successor states. In short, agreements are not sufficient to build peace.},

	abstract = {When the world’s newest state, the Republic of South Sudan, suddenly plunged into a violent civil war in 2013, the East African regional trade block, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), rapidly responded to mediate a settlement and arrest the situation which threatened the viability of the young State as well as the security and stability of the whole region. However, the mediation process had all the hallmarks of Sudan’s Comprehensive Peace Agreement that had ended the North-South war in the former Sudan and facilitated the secession of South Sudan. This raised questions over what lessons from the CPA might be useful in producing a more just, durable and sustainable peace, and how to avoid the pitfalls which nearly killed the CPA. This paper is a review of the Addis Ababa-based, IGAD-led peace process. It focuses on highlighting risks which may stand in the way of an inclusive settlement, including the competition for power, the question of ethnic divides that have fuelled violence, the multiplicity of armed non-state actors; how to include them in a settlement without creating a gargantuan military that could bankrupt the country and remilitarise the situation. The paper concludes that careful security arrangements, power-sharing in a government of national unity, a commitment to a national constitution, institutional reforms and a programme of national cohesion, reconciliation and justice for all, are the central pillars of a settlement, without which any peace agreement would be a mere postponement of conflict.},

	abstract = {In newly independent South Sudan, the state's not yet fully demarcated territory plays an intriguing and in certain aspects contradictory role in shaping and defining personal and group identities. While neighbouring states’ armies and their proxies interfere with South Sudan's international sovereignty, Juba is itself active beyond its borders by supporting Sudanese rebels. Nonetheless, the ruling elite hold onto the model of the unified and centralised territorial nation-state with clearly demarcated borders. Alas, the state's failure to territorialise its authority creates hybridity with regard to territorial control, which impacts negatively on the state's domestic legitimacy but also weakens attempts to propagate a national identity that transcends ethnic ties. Instead, the current civil war and calls for a decentralised federal structure are evidence of the continued salience of subnational loyalties while those non-state actors, like localised militias, that fill the areas void of government presence are generally themselves sources of insecurity.},

	abstract = {After its hard-won independence in 2011, South Sudan slid quickly into violent conflict and became a theatre of enormous human suffering. This article attempts to answer the question of what went wrong, and what prospects exist for South Sudanese to forge a resilient social contract to build and sustain peace. It employs an analytical framework postulating three drivers of such a contract, at the heart of which is how core issues of conflict that underpin violent conflict and fragility have been addressed. The research findings underscore that the way the ruling elites managed the transition to statehood, the development of exclusive weak institutions, and frail social cohesion have all served to undermine peace and the development of a resilient social contract. Core issues of conflict have not been addressed, witnessed by the eruption of civil war in 2013. While the 2015 Peace Agreement provides, at least on paper, the basis for forging a new social contract that holds promise for sustaining peace, building inclusive institutions and nurturing social cohesion, its realization requires political will, strategic leadership, and a national vision, which are currently in short supply.},

	abstract = {South Sudan declared its independence after the long-term civil war in 2011, a move which was welcomed both by its inhabitants and the international community and widely supported by the African Union. However, a new civil war broke out a few years later, bringing old ethnic and power rivalries back to light. This article focuses on the causes behind the failure of the state-building process in South Sudan, power relations of its elites, and the difficulties of nation-building. Its main scope is to analyse the causes of the state failure in South Sudan which have their roots deeper in the Sudanese peace process, and which started in the 1990s and culminated with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005. All these phenomena are studied in a broader geopolitical context bearing in mind also relations with neighbouring states, including parent state Sudan, and with international organisations and the African Union in particular. From a methodological point of view, this article is an intrinsic case-study based on the analysis of documents released by the Government of South Sudan, the African Union, and various international organisations, literature, and also partly on the interviews and observations conducted at the African Union Commission, Addis Ababa, in 2011.},

The central argument in this chapter, drawing heavily on the recent history of Sudan/South Sudan and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), is that African conflict resolution and peacebuilding relies too heavily on political agreements between politico-military elites. These deals focus largely on elite power and resource-sharing arrangements. Mostly ignored are the communal and societal dynamics that initially fed the violence. Sudan/South Sudan’s persistent conflict and instability is a prime example of what happens when peace agreements are signed without due regard for the true nature and genesis of the conflict.},

	abstract = {This paper examines some key statebuilding challenges confronting South Sudan in the aftermath of the January 2011 referendum that separated this region from the Republic of Sudan. Following the referendum, the two states—the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan—face the immediate challenge of negotiating the terms of their relationship over a number of critical issues, including: the future of the contested border town of Abyei, the problem of how to divide oil revenues, the definition and demarcation of the border between the two entities, and the establishment of a citizenship regime. At the same time, even if a settlement between the two over these issues was reached, South Sudan's internal political, security and developmental challenges remain enormous. For the foreseeable future, South Sudan will remain a fragile state in need of international assistance and support. In conclusion, this paper briefly assesses the implications of the birth of South Sudan for other simmering conflicts and for the doctrine of self-determination.},
